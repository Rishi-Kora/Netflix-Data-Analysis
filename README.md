# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze and visualize data from a Netflix dataset. The project involves the following steps:<br>

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:<br> The project begins by loading the Netflix dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. It then performs data cleaning tasks, such as removing duplicates and handling missing values.<br>

2. Data Preprocessing:<br> The project preprocesses the data by standardizing and normalizing numerical features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, respectively. It also uses outlier detection techniques like the Interquartile Range (IQR) and Z-score methods to identify and handle potential outliers.<br>

3. Exploratory Data Analysis:<br> The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the data. It uses visualizations such as box plots, histograms, count plots, and line plots to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.<br>

4. Visualization:<br> The project visualizes various aspects of the Netflix dataset, including:<br>
Content Type: A count plot to compare the number of movies and TV shows.<br>

Rating Distribution: A count plot to visualize the frequency of different ratings.<br>

Release Year Trend: A line plot to show the trend of movie and TV show releases over time.<br>

Genre Popularity: A count plot to identify the most common genres.<br>

Duration Analysis: A box plot to compare the average duration of movies and TV shows.
